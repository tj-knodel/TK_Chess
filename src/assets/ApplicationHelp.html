<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>
    Chess is a very old game. We have records of its existence from the 7th century. Since them, it has gone through many changes,
    such as the elephant piece being changed to the bishop, and some rules that speed up and make the game quite interesting.
    The rules we know of today emerged in Europe around the 15th century, with the rules being standardized with the rise of
    organized chess tournaments at the end of the 19th century. Modern chess has 5 different pieces: pawns, rooks, knights,
    queens, and the all important kings, and has rules for castling, en passant, and pawn double move, which will be explained
    more fully later in this document.
</p>
<h2 id="Rules">Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>
    You may have heard of all sorts of Gambits, Mates, Openings, and such, but those are strategies and you can learn about those
    later on. The rules of the game are
    actually fairly simple. The goal of the game is to put the opposing colours King in <i>checkmate</i>. I will explain checkmate in a
    little bit.</p>
    <p>Each piece moves in a particular way, but there are some general rules. A piece can't move in such away that it puts your own king in check,
    which we will get to later when we talk about checkmate. A piece can't <i>capture</i> its own colours piece. Capturing is when you move a piece
    onto the opposing colours piece, removing it from the board. Now, onto the movement. First I will start with the simple ones.</p>
    <p>The rook, the one that looks like a little castle, can move as far as possible in either a horizontal or vertical direction. It has
    a special move with the king where if there are no spaces between the king and the rook and neither of them have moved, you can
    essentially swap places. This is a very useful move to protect your precious king. You can see an example of this in the tutorial section.</p>

    <p>The bishop moves diagonally across the board as far as it can go. Very simple.</p>

    <p>The knight has the unique ability to "jump" across pieces. It moves in an L shape, two spaces away and one space to the side.</p>

    <p>The queen has the movement of both the bishop and the rook, thus making it a very important piece.</p>

    <p>The pawn is an odd one. For their first move, they can move up to two spaces. After that, they can only move one space. They can only capture
    a piece that is diagonal to them, oddly enough. They also have a unique ability called "en passant" which is difficult to explain, but
    we have a section for it in the tutorial section.</p>

    <p>The king can move one space in any direction.
    Very simple, very boring. It can't move into any space where another piece can potentially capture it.</p>
    <p>When yours or the opponents king is attacked by a piece but is able to get into safety somehow
    (on a square that is not being attacked), this is called <i>check</i>. Then for checkmate, this means that your
    colour's pieces <i>attacks</i> the opponents King in such away that it cannot move to a space where it isn't attacked. Naturally,
    you want to avoid your King being checkmated as well. You can see an example of checkmate in the tutorial section.</p>

    <p>Finally, there are some unique situations where the game can end in a draw. If you and your opponent only have a king left on the board, that is stalemate
    and the game is a draw. If you get into a situation where you or your opponent is in check but cannot make a legal move, that is stalemate.
    And the game can also end in a draw if no piece has been captured and no pawn has moved in the last 50 moves. You may not have
    to worry about this, but best to keep in mind.</p>

    <p>And those are all the rules to chess. The best way to learn strategy is just to start playing! Enjoy!</p>
