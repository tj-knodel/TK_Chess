<p>too bad, skill issue</p>
<p>I apologize for my friend here. You may want some help learning how to play chess.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>
    Chess is a very old game. We have records of its existence from the 7th century. Since them, it has gone through many changes,
    such as the elephant piece being changed to the bishop, and some rules that speed up and make the game quite interesting.
    The rules we know of today emerged in Europe around the 15th century, with the rules being standardized with the rise of
    organized chess tournaments at the end of the 19th century. Modern chess has 5 different pieces: pawns, rooks, knights,
    queens, and the all important kings, and has rules for castling, en passant, and pawn double move, which will be explained
    more fully later in this document.
</p>
<h2 id="Rules">Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>
    You may have heard of all sorts of Gambits, Mates, Openings, and such, but those are strategies. The rules of the game are
    actually fairly simple. The goal of the game is to put the opposing colours King in <i>checkmate</i>. This means that your
    colours pieces <i>attacks</i> the opponents King in such away that it cannot move to a space where it isn't attacked. Naturally,
    you want to avoid your King being checkmated as well.
